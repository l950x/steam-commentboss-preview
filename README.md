This project is built to automate a “rep for rep” system on Steam, where it comments on other users profiles in order to receive profile comments in return — helping boost visibility, engagement, and social proof.

## 📑 Overview

Steam-CommentBoss is a powerful tool designed to **automate Steam community interactions**. It consists of two core modules:

- **Scraper**: Extracts relevant Steam artwork links from given sources, including profiles, artworks, and shared files.
- **Auto-Commenter**: Uses Selenium to log into Steam and post custom comments on extracted links.

The tool intelligently tracks progress, ensuring that links are not commented on multiple times. It features automatic login detection, preventing disruptions if Steam logs out. Additionally, a detailed logging system keeps track of every action, making it easy to monitor progress, errors, and interactions.
